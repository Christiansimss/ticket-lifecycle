First on the user page we will want to open a new ticket. From there we will login as one of the created users for the lab and create a ticket like showen above.

<p>
Next as the agent we will open the ticket. Within the ticket we can assign the ticket to the current agent as well as change the status and priority. After changing the information we have the option to transfer the ticket over to anther department as shown above.

<p>
When looking back on the transfered ticket we can see something interesting. This photo above shows that when every this is a modification to the ticket as well as a comment it is posted and docummented on the osTicket system.

</p>
<p>
The finally portion of the osticking would be the ticket status section within the ticket. Here we can decided depending on the situation to leave the ticket Open and further comment on the ticket to gain information on the steps to resolve the ticket, resolve the ticket to complete it and or close the ticket because it was either resolved or a false problem. When done leaving a comment with the status as resolved the ticket will clear and be gone from the agents ticket page.
